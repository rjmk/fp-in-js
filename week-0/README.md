# Getting Used to the Setup

This is just for messing around with how things work.
Try and make things break and then fix them again.

## Let's play around with new JS features

In `arrow-functions.js` there are a few examples of arrow functions.
Run it with `npm run babel -- week-0/arrow-functions.js`

If you uncomment the commented code,
some of the output is not what's expected.

In `classes.js` you can see some examples of ES6 Classes.
They're kind of pointless outside of flow.

## Let's play around with flow

**[Flow](https://flowtype.org/)**

In `flow-maths` you'll see some type-annotated code.
`npm run flow` should show no errors.
If you uncomment the commented code and try again,
there should be some.

In `flow-array` you should see some code with arrays and arrow functions.
Play around with changing the type parameter (The `X` in `<X>`)

In `flow-sum` we play around with defining our own sum type.
See if you can fix the broken (commented out) code in multiple ways
